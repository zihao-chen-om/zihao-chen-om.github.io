Welcome to my website! I am Zihao Chen, a PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research centers on operations management, with a focus on the operation-marketing interface, service operations management, and socially responsible operations. I examine the interactions among consumers, sellers, and supply chain entities to investigate optimal decision-making processes and analyze how equilibrium affects consumer surplus and social welfare. My methodology involves game-theoretic and stochastic modeling. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ying-Ju Chen](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ying-ju-chen). Before my PhD program, I studied Electrical Engineering. You can download my CV here: [CV_Zihao Chen](../assets/CV_Zihao Chen.pdf). My email: zihao.chen@connect.ust.hk

   * Abstract: This study examines a seller's joint information disclosure and pricing decisions when launching a new product with an easy-to-communicate objective attribute and a hard-to-describe subjective attribute. We investigate how consumer search cost, inventory level, and channel structure influence the seller's optimal information policy. For brick-and-mortar retailing, our analysis suggests that the seller should conceal (or disclose) information when the search cost is low (or high). Interestingly, when the inventory level is high, the seller conceals information to retain the diamond-in-the-rough consumers, aiming to match the abundant inventory with high demand. Conversely, when inventory is low, the seller discloses information to dissuade some consumers with low objective valuations from searching, thereby reducing demand and alleviating concerns about product unavailability. In other words, the seller uses information to balance search and stock. The structure of optimal information policy is robust after considering several extensions such as partial disclosure, efficient allocation, and atomic consumers. In addition, surprisingly, fiercer demand-side competition (e.g., larger consumer population) can reduce the seller's revenue due to potential price markdowns to ease consumer concerns about competition. For omnichannel retailing with an additional online purchasing channel, our analysis suggests that abundant inventory can lead to a contrary information policy from the offline business. Collectively, our study provides managerial insights into how demand-side factors (e.g., search cost) and supply-side factors (e.g., inventory level and channel structure) impact the seller's optimal information and pricing strategy. It also reveals potential risks associated with intensified demand-side competition.
